     <p>We see street lights as one of the most valuable public assets that have a powerful role to play in making cities energy-efficient, resilient and future-ready.
      The traditional method of controlling street lamp lighting could not adjust the brightness of bulbs, while the management and maintenance had to rely on labour patrol. LoRaWAN technology with LED lights is an advanced controlling method for street lighting, particularly resolves the issues in monitoring and energy consumption. The system we built incorporates a levels Street Light Control, Managing Substation and Street Light Managing Centre.LoRaWAN wireless communication technologies formed the bridge of the general system, and helped achieve remote control of street lighting, monitoring and fault warning.
      The Smart Street Light System is just the first step towards developing a much more advanced multifunctional smart city platform. Focused on quality, reliability, and innovation, Team Fierce offers a complete solution package of controls and sensors, enabling luminaire manufacturers, utilities, and municipalities to make better use of resources, save operating costs and protect the environment by managing energy better
